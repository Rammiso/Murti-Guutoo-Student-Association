# 🤝 Contributing Guidelines

1. Always create a feature branch:
2. Commit messages format:
3. Push to your branch and open a Pull Request (PR).
4. PRs should be reviewed by at least one teammate before merging.
5. Never push directly to `main`.

✅ Branches

- `main` — production ready
- `dev` — testing/integration
- `feature/*` — new features or fixes
